# FeedBat — Chrome Web Store Submission Guide

Everything below is in this repo. Follow it top to bottom; it takes ~20 minutes.

---

## 0. One-time prerequisites

- A Chrome Web Store developer account (you have this).
- The **$5 one-time** developer registration fee paid (required before your
  first item can be published — pay it at the dashboard if you haven't).

---

## 1. Publish the privacy policy (GitHub Pages)

Chrome will not approve the listing without a reachable privacy policy URL.

1. Commit & push the `docs/` folder (done as part of the PR for this work).
2. On GitHub: **Settings → Pages**.
3. **Source:** `Deploy from a branch` → Branch: **`master`** → Folder:
   **`/docs`** → **Save**.
4. Wait ~1–3 minutes for the first deploy.
5. **Verify it returns HTTP 200 before continuing:**
   ```bash
   curl -sI https://schmug.github.io/FeedBat/privacy.html | head -1
   # expect: HTTP/2 200
   ```
   The landing page also lives at https://schmug.github.io/FeedBat/ .

> The submission form rejects an unreachable privacy URL. Don't skip the curl
> check — Pages has a deploy lag.

## 2. Build the upload package

```bash
./build.sh
```

Produces `dist/feedbat-1.0.0.zip` with `manifest.json` at the archive root and
dev-only files excluded. The script prints `unzip -l` so you can confirm the
layout before uploading.

---

## 3. Generate the listing images

1. Open `store-assets/screenshot-studio.html` in **Chrome** (File → Open).
2. For each panel, click **Download PNG**:
   - `marketing-screenshot-1.png` (1280×800) — **required, at least this one**
   - `marketing-screenshot-2.png`, `marketing-screenshot-3.png` (optional)
   - `promo-small-440x280.png` (recommended)
   - `promo-marquee-1400x560.png` (optional)
3. If a download looks off in your browser, use the fallback: DevTools →
   right-click the framed element → **Capture node screenshot**, or your OS
   screenshot tool on the framed area.

## 5. Submit for review

Click **Submit for review**. First reviews typically take a few hours to a few
business days. You'll get an email on approval or with rejection reasons.

---

## 6. If it gets rejected — likely causes & fixes

| Rejection reason | Fix |
|---|---|
| Privacy policy URL unreachable | Re-run the `curl` check; confirm Pages source is `master` `/docs`. |
| "Broad host permissions not justified" | We already minimized to `activeTab`; ensure the justification text was pasted verbatim. |
| Missing/incorrect data disclosures | Re-check all 9 categories = NOT collected + 3 certifications ticked. |
| Screenshot wrong size | Must be exactly 1280×800 or 640×400. Re-export from the studio. |
| Single purpose unclear | Use the one-sentence statement exactly as written. |

---

## Known limitations (not blockers, good to know)

- `activeTab` is granted when the popup opens. If the user navigates the tab
  while the popup is still open, the **Check common paths** probe will fail with
  a "Reopen FeedBat and try again" message — by design, not a bug.
- Feed detection reads the live DOM, so on heavy single-page apps a feed that
  loads after detection runs may require reopening the popup (YouTube is handled
  specially via SPA navigation events).

---

## Post-approval

- Tag the release: `git tag v1.0.0 && git push --tags`.
- Future updates: bump `"version"` in `chrome-extension/manifest.json`, re-run
  `./build.sh`, upload the new zip, submit again.
